<h2>Our experiences in thailand</h2> 

<p>So like i said earlyer we had differnt kinds of experiences while traveling in thailand 
i will share with you some of the things happen to us is every place i recommended.</p>
<ul>
<li><B>Chiang mai</B> - the first place we traveled was chiang mai we got there at 11pm and were pretty shocked and we asked 
the taxi driver to game us to the wrong hotel so we drove for 55 minutes and got to a scary hotel in the 
middle of nowhere, there where only teenagers there and no one spoke english.. not a great start..
but we came to our senses and booked another hotel on the wedsite of <a href="https://www.booking.com/" target="_blank">booking.com</a> and called another 
taxi to take us and every thing end up well. we went to an elephant shelter for elephants and it was an amazing experience,
we feed them and washed them in the river and just spend the day looking out for them. </li><br>


<li><B>Bangkok</B> - bangkok is incredible a huge city with hundreds of skyscrapers, we went to a few malls 
each one you can walk for hours and not see all the stores, there are a lot of modern restaurants but most 
importantly a KFC store in every corner <span style='font-size:20px;'>&#129316;</span>. we visited the sea world witch is the bigges in all of asia and it was 
truely beautiful to see. it was also where we flew back home only we missed the plane and end up buying 
another plane ticket :(  again lots of differnt experiences. </li><br>

<li><B>Ko samui</B> - ko samui was so magical with its beautiful white beaches.
we booked an amazing hotel right on the beach, we rented a motorcycle it was exciting and scary at the same time
becase i never drove a motorcycle befor and in thailand they drive at the opposite lane so concerned for our lifes
we returned the motorcycle and rented a car it was great we did a trip all around the island, stopped at a couple 
of breathtaking lookout sites and drove the a famous temple. at the evening we went the farmer's market
it had varity of goods you can buy from the  many sales booths. </li><br>


<li><B>Ko pha-ngan</B> - in ko pha-ngan we meet a jewish couple from new york that were our age and where 
on there honeymoon as well, we clicked right away and end up spending five days together, we took them 
to a famous israeli restaurant on the island owned by a israeli man that relocated to ko pha-ngan,
the dishes where of israeli cuisine and we all enjoyed very much, it was a little riminder from home.
we also took an organized boat trip to see the amazing nature and landscape surrounding ko pha-ngan.</li><br>

<li><B>Phuket</B> - finelly phuket, the truth is that it was our least favorit place but its due to our personality,
phuket i known for hernt extravaga night life scene with lots of dance and sex clubs and we dont like
to go to this kind of places especially not on a honeymoon but if thats something you love phuket is 
the perfect place for you, it also has great seafood restaurants where the food is very fresh , the freshest it gets.
and unfortunately my wife's engagement ring got stolen from our hotel room, we did learn not leave valuables in the suitcase. <span style='font-size:20px;'>&#128533;</span></li><br>
